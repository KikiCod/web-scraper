# Performing Web Scraping with Python
This Python program collects and prints out specific header tags (h1, h2, h3) from a website that the user inputs.

**Installation**
To run this program, you must have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website here.

You will also need to install the following Python libraries:
**requests**
**beautifulsoup4**
You can install these libraries using pip, a package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following commands:
```
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
**Usage**
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the web_scraping.py file.
2. Enter the following command to run the program:
> python web_scraping.py
3. When prompted, enter the URL of the website you want to scrape. Make sure the URL is in the correct format (e.g. https://www.example.com).
4. The program will then collect all the header tags (h1, h2, h3) from the website and print them out to the terminal.

**Limitations**
Please note that web scraping can be restricted or prohibited by some websites' terms of service or by law. Always check the website's terms of use before attempting to scrape it. Additionally, this program is only designed to scrape header tags from a website. If you want to scrape other types of data, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
